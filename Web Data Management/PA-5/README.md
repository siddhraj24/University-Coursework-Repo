# Programming Assignment 5

## Description
This programming assignment is focused on learning DOM, XPath, and XSLT to query XML data. In this project, you will use a text editor or an IDE to develop Java programs.

## Documentation
The following web pages provide tutorials and references for this project:
- XPath Tutorial
- Another XPath Tutorial
- Java API for javax.xml.xpath
- XSLT Tutorial
- Another XSLT Tutorial
- XSL Transformations (by XML Bible)

## Project Requirements
The project requires you to consider the provided XML document (recipes.xml) along with its DTD that describes recipes. Write an XSLT program (recipe.xsl) to display the recipes in a web browser. The XSLT program should generate HTML code, and it should display all data except the related elements. Use the Java program xslt.java to test your XSLT program, and then load the resulting HTML output file in your web browser.

## Files
All the required files for the project are present in the zip folder PA5:
- xpath.java
- xslt-example.xsl
- xslt.java
- cs.xml
- recipes.xml
- recipes.dtd
