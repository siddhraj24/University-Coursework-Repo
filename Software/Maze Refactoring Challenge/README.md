# The Amazing Maze Refactoring Challenge

This is a refactored version of the original code for "The Amazing Maze" game, published in the old computer magazine "Creative Computing" back in the 70s. This version has been updated to run on modern machines and programming languages like Python.

You can find the original code in the book "Basic Computer Games", which is available online for free here: https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/index.php.

To run the game, simply execute the "sps7988_lab3A.py" file using Python.
