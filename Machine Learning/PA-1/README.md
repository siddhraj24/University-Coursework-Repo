## Project: PA-1

This project implements the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch and includes functions to evaluate it with k-fold cross-validation. The following libraries are used in this project:

- random: Used to generate random numbers for seed and to get a random index.
- math: Used to perform mathematical operations such as square root, exponential, and pi.
- numpy: Used for numerical computations and for creating arrays.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- csv: Used to read data from a csv file.

The Jupyter notebook file containing the implementation is named PA-1.ipynb.

## Instructions for running the code:

1. Install Jupyter notebook and the required libraries (if not already installed).
2. Download the PA-1.ipynb file and open it in Jupyter notebook.
3. Make sure that the dataset file is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook file.
4. Run the code cells in the Jupyter notebook.

The dataset used in this project should be in CSV format and contain the target variable in the last column. The code assumes that the dataset file is named "dataset.csv". If the file name is different, make sure to update the file name in the code.

Note: This project was implemented as a part of the Machine Learning course (CSE 6363).
